We are happy to announce that **2.1.1** is released.

2.1.1 is mainly a security and bug fix release that addresses **multiple security issues** indentified by Antonio Morales from GitHub Security Lab (GHSL).
If you are using any earlier version of FreeRDP we recommend updating to 2.1.1. The security advisories will be published on [the FreeRDP security advisory page on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories).

As usual the tar archive can be found on [https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.1.1)

Since 2.1.0 there have been around 70 commits, from about 6 individual contributors.
**Thank you all for your support!**.

Besides the mentioned fixes there are also some stability and other improvements. If you are interested in in the changes
since 2.1.0 have a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.1.1/ChangeLog)
respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/14?closed=1) or use git log for a detailed list.
