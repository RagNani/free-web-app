<p>FreeRDP community,</p>
<p>Following the Android client release, I am pleased to announce the release of the iOS client! An announcement has been made by Thinstuff on the mailing list:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Thinstuff is proud to announce that iFreeRDP, the FreeRDP iOS client, is now available on git master.</p>
<p>As with the Android port we are sorry that it took so long for the iOS port to be released. However, we think iFreeRDP turned out just as awesome as aFreeRDP and it was definitely worth the wait.</p>
<p>Like its Android counterpart, iFreeRDP is quite mature and comes with a lot of hot features:<br />
* A touch pointer for easier user input within a session<br />
* Gestures for common input tasks like scrolling, zooming, etc.<br />
* Custom keyboard views for advanced user input (i.e. common shortcuts like Win+E)<br />
* A flexible connection management UI allowing to quickly connect to a host as well as handling a large list with multiple predefined connections<br />
* Built-in help for touch pointer and gestures</p>
<p>iFreeRDP integrates seamlessly into FreeRDP&#8217;s build system. For detailed build instructions refer to docs/README.ios. You will need the regular iOS development environment: Mac OS X, Xcode and the iOS SDK. As you probably know, compiling and deploying to a real iOS device requires a developer account.</p>
<p>Thinstuff will be publishing and supporting iFreeRDP on the App Store, making it convenient for users to get started. The application has not yet been submitted for approval, we intend to do it soon. The initial approval process can be lengthy, so please be patient. Another announcement will be made when iFreeRDP becomes available on the App Store.</p>
<p>Thinstuff strongly believes in FreeRDP and we think that iFreeRDP is a perfect addition to the project, completing the current support for mobile clients. We hope you will like it just as much as we do!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Your Thinstuff Team</p></blockquote>
