We are happy to announce that the fourth release candidate of the 2.0.0 series **2.0.0-rc3** is now
available for download.

The tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the github [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc3).

Since 2.0.0-rc2 there have been more than 250 commits, from 23 individual contributors. Thank you all for
your support.

If you are interested in the changes since rc2 have a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.0.0-rc3/ChangeLog)
respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/9?closed=1) or use git log for a detailed list.

This is a pre-release of the upcoming 2.0.0 release. If all goes according to plan the next release will be final.

If you want to help us smashing the remaining issues or if you interested have a look at the open issues for the
[2.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/10).

Note: People linking against FreeRDP should be aware that, until the final release is done, some minor changes in ABI/API might still happen (although we try to keep them to a minimum).
