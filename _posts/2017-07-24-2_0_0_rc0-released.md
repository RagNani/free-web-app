It's been quite a while since the last release...
But we are happy to announce that we've just tagged 
the first release candidate for 2.0.0 . The pre-created
tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the github release page:
[https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc0](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc0)

This is a pre-release of the upcoming 2.0.0 release. There will
be more release candidates before the final release. If you are interested
in the open issues for -rc1 have a look at 
[rc1 milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2.0-rc1)

Until 2.0.0 is released some minor changes in the ABI/API might still happen but we try to keep them to a minimum.

Since our latest stable release a lot of changes were done. We put
a lot of effort into making the FreeRDP libraries and client more
stable and secure.

For 2.0.0 the main target platforms are Android, Linux, and Windows.
iOS and Mac are still supported and we make sure that the library and
client compile but due to the lack of man power we are current not actively
improving those architectures. 

# What to expect in the future?

This are the plans for future releases (starting with 2.0.0):

* one "major" release (where master is branched to stable) each year
* at least one minor release of the stable version (bug and security fixes)
* a released version will be supported for two years (one year bug and security fixes and one year
  security fixes only)
