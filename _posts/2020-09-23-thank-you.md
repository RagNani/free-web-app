Dear FreeRDP Community,

As you might know FreeRDP is the leading, most up-to-date open source
implementation of the RDP protocol suite. A lot of people are using our
project on a variety of platforms for both - private and commercial use,
including Microsoft itself.

With the increasing popularity of remote desktop and desktop virtualization solutions during these difficult times
including freeRDP, we are receiving more and more support requests from
users using FreeRDP.

Therefore we want to highlight again the most important links for FreeRDP:
