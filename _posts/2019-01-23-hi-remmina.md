title: Hi! Remmina - a multiprotocol remote desktop client.

Remmina is (or aims to be) a multiprotocol remote desktop client. It
supports RDP (via libfreerdp), SSH, VNC, SPICE and other remote desktop
protocols, featuring a very nice profile editor, and it can save
credentials into gnome keyring or kdewallet.


According to our statistics, more than 60% of the profiles defined by
the Remmina users are RDP, the resting 40% is shared
among VNC, SSH, SPICE, NX and XDMCP. This highlight the importance of
the RDP protocol for Remmina and we want to thank the FreeRDP team for
maintaining such an amazing project and for having always supported
Remmina from the beginning.


The main Remmina strengths are:
The ability to keep a list of multiple profiles for faster access, and
the fact that profile management is completely GUI based, therefore
there is no need to remember or search help for complex command line
options.

Multiple simultaneous connections with very flexible windowing
abilities makes Remmina desirable by people who need quick access to
many different RDP or SSH servers. It features remote desktop windows
grouping, scaling, dynamic resolution update (for RDP only), quick
switch between full-screen and windowed mode and many other
interesting features very appreciated by Microsoft Windows server
sysadmins, and for those Unix admins that manage several different
customers with many SSH or KVM servers (through SPICE or VNC).


Remmina was initially developed by Vic Lee till the second half of 2011,
after that it has been adopted (temporarily) by the FreeRDP project, but
only few contributions were coming to Remmina as the FreeRDP project
was too busy with our beloved library. Finally, in the second half of
the 2014, because of the pushy prayers of Antenore and Giovanni,
Marc-Andr√© Moreau gave the maintainer access to Antenore, immediately
followed by Giovanni.

Today Remmina is still maintained by Antenore and Giovanni, plus some
very important contributors, that keep helping us improving the project
(please see the Thanks.md page).

Remmina is now installed by several thousands people and as we are
collecting statistics, we will be able soon to understand in depth how
many of those are really used and how. We hope, with these statistics,
to be able to better target our user needs to maximize what we do.
We want to remind to everybody, as usual, that Remmina is developed for
free, in our free time, therefore _maximizing_ our efforts is a key
factor.
