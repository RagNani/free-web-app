We are happy to announce that the third release candidate of the 2.0.0 series **2.0.0-rc2** is now
available for download.

The tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the github [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc2).

This pre-release includes a fix that addresses problems introduced with 
[KB4088776](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4088776/windows-10-update-kb4088776) see [issue #4449](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/4449) for all details.

Since 2.0.0-rc1 there have been more than 400 commits, from 25 individual contributors. Thank you all for
your support.

If you are interested in the changes since rc1 have a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.0.0-rc2/ChangeLog)
respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/8?closed=1) or use git log for a detailed list.

This is a pre-release of the upcoming 2.0.0 release. If all goes according to plan there will be one
more release canidate (rc3) before the final release.

If you want to help us smashing the remaining issues or if you interested have a look at the open issues for the
[rc3 milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/9).

Note: People linking against FreeRDP should be aware that, until the final release is done, some minor changes in ABI/API might still happen (although we try to keep them to a minimum).
