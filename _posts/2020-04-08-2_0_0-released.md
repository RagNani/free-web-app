I must admit: The release took way longer than expected. We released 2.0.0-rc0 back in 2017 and planned to do the final release
really soon afterwards but it turned out a little different :).

Now we are happy to announce that FreeRDP 2.0.0 is available for download.

The tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0)

Since 2.0.0-rc4 there have been more than 1489 commits, from about 50 individual contributors.
**Thank you all for your support!**

If you are interested in the changes since rc4 have a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.0.0/ChangeLog)
respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/12?closed=1) or use git log for a detailed list.


# What to expect in the future?

For future releases we will try to move to a kind of "rolling" release model.

This will look like the following:

* one "major" release (where master is branched to stable) each year
* minor (fix) releases around every half year or if necessary
* at least one minor release of the stable version (bug and security fixes)
* a major release will be supported for two years (one year bug and security fixes and one year security fixes only)
