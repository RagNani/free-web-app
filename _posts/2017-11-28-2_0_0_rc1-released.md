We are very happy to announce the second release candidate of the 2.0.0 series **2.0.0-rc1** is now available for download.

The tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the github [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc1)

Since 2.0.0-rc0 there have been more than 330 commits, from 32 individual contributors. Thank you all for
your support.

If you are interested in the changes since rc0 have a look at the [Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.0.0-rc1/ChangeLog)
respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/7) or use git log for a detailed list.

This is a pre-release of the upcoming 2.0.0 release. There will be one, maybe two, more release
canidates before the final release.
If you want to help us smashing issues or if you interested have a look at the open issues for the
[rc2 milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/8).

People linking against FreeRDP should be aware that until the final release is done some minor changes in
ABI/API might still happen (although we try to keep them to a minimum).
