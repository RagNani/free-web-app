We are happy to announce that the fifth release candidate of the 2.0.0 series **2.0.0-rc4** is now
available for download.

rc4 is an intermediate release candidate that addresses **multiple CVEs** indentified by Eyal Itkin
from Check Point Software Technologies. If you already using any 2.0 release candidate we recommend
to update to rc4.

The tar archive can be found on [http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the github [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.0.0-rc4).

Since 2.0.0-rc3 there have been more than 300 commits, from just about 25 individual contributors,
and 170 closed pull request and issues. Thank you all for your support.

If you are interested in the changes since rc3 have a look at the
[Changelog](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/blob/2.0.0-rc4/ChangeLog) respectively the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/10?closed=1)
or use git log for a detailed list.

We are (still) working towards a final 2.0.0 version. If you want to help us smashing the remaining
issues or if you are interested have a look at the open issues for the
[2.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/milestone/12).

Note: People linking against FreeRDP should be aware that, until the final release is done, some
changes in ABI/API might still happen.
