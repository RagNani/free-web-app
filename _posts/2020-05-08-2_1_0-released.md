We are happy to announce that **2.1.0** is released.

2.1.0 is mainly a security and bug fix release that addresses **multiple security issues** indentified by hac425.
If you are using any earlier version of FreeRDP we recommend updating to 2.1.0. The security advisories will be published on [the FreeRDP security advisory page on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/security/advisories).

As usual the tar archive can be found on [https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and
here is the link to the GitHub [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.1.0)

Since 2.0.0 there have been around 100 commits, from about 16 individual contributors.
**Thank you all for your support!**. Special thank to akallabeth for working on the security issues and preparing 2.1.0.

Besides the mentioned fixes there are also some new features, stability and other fixes. If you are interested in in the changes
